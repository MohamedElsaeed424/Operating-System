MUTEX:
- Read/Write file (writeFile, readFile)
- User input (input)
- outputting to screen (print, printFromTo)
- Lock/Unlock resource (semWait, semSignal)
Memory:
- Store PCB (name, value)
- Variables can be string or int
- Lines of code (i.e. Instruction 1: assign a input)
- Memory cells are all composed of the same data structure (Pair: name, value)
Ideas for scheduling:
- for scheduling processes for resources, Iterate over the queue and remove the highest by keeping track of the address of the max and prev.
Queue:
- Array or linkedList?
- size of process in memory with code = 6 (PCB) + 7(lines of code) + 3 (variables) = 16 memory cells
- size of process without code = 9 memory cells
- max num of processes with code = 60/16 = 3.75 ~ 4 processes
- max num of processes without code = 60/9 =~ 7 processes
